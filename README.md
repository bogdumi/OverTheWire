# OverTheWire

Collection of OverTheWire CTF flags. Each folder's name is the challenge name, 
and within each folder is a file similarly 
named that contains the flags, with the following format:

  `username flag`

each on their own line. The folders may also contain auxiliary tools 
that were used to retrieve the flags (for example, code payloads).
